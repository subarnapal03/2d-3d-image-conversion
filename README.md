# 2d-3d-image-conversion
The 2D to 3D conversion project focuses on transforming flat, two-dimensional images into three-dimensional models. Utilizing advanced algorithms and computer vision techniques, the project aims to extract depth information from 2D images, creating a 3D representation that preserves the original image's features and details. This process involves edge detection, depth estimation, and mesh generation to produce a realistic 3D model. The project's applications are vast, including virtual reality, gaming, medical imaging, and digital art. By enabling the creation of 3D models from existing 2D images, the project opens new possibilities for visualization and interaction in various fields.
